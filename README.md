# arma-to-socket
Communicate between arma 3 and other processes/languages. using TCP sockets.

originally intended to allow my home made controller/fligh control panel to access arma information, now a much broader and useful extension for the arma platform.

### Please do submit pull request, as I would rather 1 centralised version than load of different ones.


Currently only support TCP, planning to include UDP in the next couple days.
